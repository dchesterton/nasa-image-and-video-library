# NASA Image and Video Library

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) using TypeScript for the language, Redux for state management and Aphrodite for CSS-in-JS.

I loosely followed [NASA's own design guidelines](https://github.com/bruffridge/nasawds) for Typography and colour.

Given more time I would:

-   Add routing
-   Add search-as-you-type functionality
-   Add subtle animations to make the UI slicker

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode. See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
